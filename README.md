# Evolve
Investing is important, if not critical, to make your money work for you. You work hard for your money and your money should work hard for you. Investing is how you take charge of your financial security. It allows you to grow your wealth but also generate an additional income stream if needed ahead of retirement. So, investment portfolio management is one of the most important tasks for any investor. Portfolio managers are people who perform portfolio management for their clients but they need to be paid a good amount of money. And for small and medium sized portfolios, management can be done easily by the investor itself. All that the investor needs is a platform where they can manage all of their assets and take further investment decisions based on insights from the platform as well as their own. This is the exact problem that Evolve is trying to solve.

**Evolve is an online investment portfolio management system where users can keep track of all the assets that they have invested in and how well their assets are performing.** It also provides the users with information regarding various markets like the stock market, crypto market etc. and also gives insights on various asset buying and selling decisions. This can be a more affordable alternative to hiring portfolio managers at higher costs. It also has a beautiful UI to make it user friendly and visually appealing.

**Evolve - the only online investment portfolio manager that youâ€™ll ever need.**
